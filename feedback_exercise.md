# Feedback Exersice


## Got feedback from our TA Pranav Dommata:
1.) Do the overall layout/organization of the views first. Make a high level
    overview.

2.) Have a view to navigate through each gubbin<sup>1</sup>.

3.) Look at existing metric monitoring software for visualization ideas. Like
    [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) or
    [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana).

4.) Have a dashboard to highlight gubbins that need attention (running
    unusually slow/have a high number of errors or panics).


## How we'll address the feedback.
1.) Initially, we anticipated building all of the sub views, and then doing the
    overall layout and organization last. We will now reorder our planned
    schedule to do this first.

2.) We will build out a view that will simply list all of the gubbins with
    links to the different types of visualizations provided.

3.) We will do this first, before designing anything, to get ideas about what
    existing monitoring visualization services already provide. And how we can
    make ours BETTER.

4.) This will be an optional feature, because it would require more analysis
    work (without visualization) to detect abnormalities. But this would become
    part of the main overview/dashboard/home page.

This feedback was fair and helpful in reorganizing our priorities and directing
more attention to the initial navigation and organization of gubbins.


<sup>1</sup>Gubbin (noun): A function, which has multiple timing metrics.
                           Represents a row from a matrix with multiple columns
                           of timing data.
